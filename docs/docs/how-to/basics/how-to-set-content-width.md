# How to Set Content Width

:::info
[Automatic.css](https://automaticcss.com) users do not need to do follow this tutorial. ACSS sets and manages your content width and you can adjust it in the ACSS dashboard.
:::

Etch sets the max-width of **Container** elements to `var(--content-width)` by default with a fallback value of `1366px`. This is why you the **Container** element (which is added to **Sections** by default) is `1366px` out of the box.

Since this default is set with a fallback value in an undefined variable, it has zero effect on your preferences should you want to set a different value.

So let's talk about setting a different value!

All you have to do to set your own custom content width is open the Style Manager by clicking the paint brush icon in the sidebar:

![Open the Style Manager](../../interface/img/style-manager.avif)

Once the style manager is open, switch to the Variables Manager tab and then add this variable:

```css
--content-width: 1280px;
```

That's it! Now all your **Container** elements will be your new desired width.
