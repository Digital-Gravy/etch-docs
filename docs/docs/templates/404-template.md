# 404 Template

The 404 template is displayed when a user visits a URL that doesn't exist on your website. This template is crucial for maintaining a good user experience and helping visitors find what they're looking for when they encounter broken or mistyped links.

## When the 404 Template is Used

WordPress automatically displays the 404 template when:
- A user visits a URL that doesn't match any existing content
- A post or page has been deleted but the URL is still being accessed
- Someone types an incorrect URL
- A link points to content that no longer exists
- Search engines or other sites link to outdated URLs
