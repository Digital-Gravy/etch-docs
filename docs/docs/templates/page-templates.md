# Page Templates

:::warning
It is our official stance that WordPress page templates are dinosaur architecture. While you can create them, you're almost always better off creating a Custom Post Type and using CPT-related templates.
:::

Page templates in Etch are created from the Posts/Pages column in the Template Manager.

Currently, it's only possible to create a template that would override your index template for any page-based content. Since pages tend to be unique in layout and content, they typically don't need to be templated. We'll be producing more content in the future as to why templating pages is not a great idea. For now, we recommend turning your attention to Custom Post Types, components, and patterns.
