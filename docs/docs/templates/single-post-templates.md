# Single Post Templates

Single post templates control how individual blog posts are displayed on your website. These templates are essential for any site with a blog or content that needs individual post pages.

## When to Use Single Post Templates

Single post templates are automatically used by WordPress when:
- A user clicks on a blog post title from an archive or listing page
- Someone visits a direct URL to a specific blog post
- You want to display individual posts with full content, metadata, and related elements

## Key Dynamic Data Keys

When building single post templates, you have access to all the standard dynamic data keys using the `this.` prefix.

For example, `this.title` will display the title of the post. You can see [all dynamic data keys here](../dynamic-data/dynamic-data-keys).
