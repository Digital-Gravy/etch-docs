# Need to Know

Etch is different from traditional page builders in many ways. Since your experience with Etch will be shaped by your expectations, we want to make sure you start off with a proper understanding of why Etch exists, why it looks different, and why it works differently.

## Why Etch Exists

Etch exists because traditional page builders were all designed around the same question: "How can we make web design super easy for laypeople?"

And when you ask that question, you end up with:

- Dumbed down, no-code / low-code interfaces
- Bloated code output (because laypeople don't care)
- Tremendous styling limitations
- Architectural limitations
- Functionality limitations
- Poor scalability and maintainability
- Poor accessibility
- A frustrating, proprietary experience
- Etc.

And after more than a decade of running this experiment of trying to get laypeople to build websites with dumbed down tools, we've discovered that it isn't really possible.

The most true laypeople can do is drop in a template, swap some colors, and edit content.

For the people who go through a significant learning curve to actually do web design type things, they end up learning the proprietary language of the specific tool rather than learning actual web design.

The result is that they might work in this industry for years, but still know hardly anything. They're nothing more than website "assembler." And they go through life with a deep sense of imposter syndrome and a general lack of confidence.

### Etch is different...

Etch is the first tool to ask a much better and more relevant and more practical question: "How can we use a visual environment to fundamentally innovate a professional web development workflow?"

Etch is the first tool to truly respect the fundamental language of web design and do things according to best practices. This results in higher quality projects (if you know what you're doing or learn) and levels up the skills of everyone who uses it (rather than trapping you in a proprietary ecosystem).

Etch is the first tool to give you full access to the code in an unprecedented way (while still empowering you to work without code if you'd like).

Etch is the first tool to full unify your development workflow so you're not bouncing around from "magic area" to "magic area" to do certain things.

Etch is true innovation and maximum efficiency. It's full flexibility and control...

It's what WordPress' visual environment should have always been.

## To Beginners & Aspiring Pros: We Believe That You're Capable of Being Capable

Etch's founder, [Kevin Geary](https://geary.co), has taught web development best practices to tens of thousands of people.

We've watched pure beginners transform into highly skilled developers by following the right trainings and using the right tools.

Traditional page builders are designed for people who don't know what they're doing and they don't bother teaching you the right way. In fact, they encourage you to do things the wrong way!

Etch is designed for people who know what they're doing OR people who want to learn. And we're 100% committed to teaching, educating, and training you if you don't already have the skills, knowledge, and experience (for free!).

This is a fundamentally different relationship and we hope you appreciate that.

If you're wanting to do actual web development, Etch is the best place to learn because it actually speaks the language of web development. Spending time in other tools will only delay your actual learning, because other tools do proprietary (and bad practice) things to close the knowledge gap.

## To Pros: We know what you want, need, and expect and that's exactly what we deliver

For years, professional web developers have been an afterthought in the world of visual builders. 

Most tools are built for laypeople, leaving pros frustrated by rigid interfaces, lack of control, and code output that doesn't meet their standards. Even traditional IDEs and code editors, while powerful, often lack the seamless integration between structure, style, and content that modern web projects demand, especially when working with Wordpress.

**Etch changes everything.** Here, professionals are not just remembered—they're prioritized. Etch is designed to give you the power, flexibility, and efficiency you expect from a top-tier development environment, but with a level of integration and workflow optimization that goes beyond what most IDEs offer.

**In Etch, you get the best of both worlds:** the power and control of a professional IDE, combined with the speed, clarity, and integration of a next-generation visual builder. For the first time, professionals have a tool that truly respects their workflow and raises the bar for what a development environment can be.

## Conclusion

Etch isn't just another page builder—it's a **Unified Visual Development Environment (UVDE)** built on respect for the craft of web development and for the people who practice it, whether you're just starting out or have years of experience. 

By combining a visual interface with direct access to real code, Etch empowers you to learn, grow, and create at the highest level. Our mission is to help you build better websites, faster, and with more confidence than ever before.

Welcome to a new era of web development. Welcome to Etch.
