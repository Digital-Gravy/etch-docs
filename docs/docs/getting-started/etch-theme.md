# The Etch Theme

Etch requires a companion block theme to function properly. The Etch theme is a minimal, blank WordPress block theme.

The Etch theme provides the necessary hooks and structure for Auto Block Authoring and Gutenberg compatibility –– no more, no less.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Do not switch themes during development or after going live.** WordPress' theme architecture is not designed for theme switching. Replacing the theme during development or production could result in:

- Loss of page layouts and content
- Broken functionality
- Incompatibility issues
- Data corruption

## Additional Insights

Themes in WordPress are outdated architecture and should be disregarded. The future of WordPress is not found in themes. The Etch theme is provided simply to meet WordPress core architectural requirements.

Users are advised to install the Etch Theme and never think about themes again. Don't consider using other block themes, don't switch themes, don't pay attention to themes, and stop caring about themes.
