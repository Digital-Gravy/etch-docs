# Basic Conditions

The simplest conditions to start with are simple single condition `if` statements.

All you have to remember is that you're programming logic to _**show**_ the elements inside the condition. Of course, if that condition doesn't resolve to showing the element, then the element is effectively hidden.

The process is simple. Ask yourself two questions:

1. What data do I want to check?
2. Should I write the statement as positive or negative to show the element?

One of the simplest conditions is based on showing a `logout` link if the user is logged in, and a `login` link if the user is logged out. Doing this as an exercise will help you understand exactly how simple `if` conditions work.

Let's ask ourselves the two questions:

- **What data do I want to check?**: In this case, we want to check the [Dynamic Data Key](/dynamic-data/dynamic-data-keys), `user.loggedIn`.
- **Should I write the statement as positive or negative to show the element?**: In this case, we want to write it as a positive to show the logout link and as a negative to show the login link.

## Conditional Logic With the UI

Add a condition element to the page by clicking the Condition Element icon:

![Etch Condition Element](../elements/img/etch-condition-element.webp)

You'll see the condition element in the structure panel. Add a link element inside of it.

When you click the condition element in the structure panel, you'll also see an exposed Attribute panel for it. It looks like this:

![Etch Conditions UI](img/etch-condition-ui.webp)

When using the UI like this, you have to remember that the `{#if}` was already written for you. So all you're doing is checking the data.

For the "is user logged in" check, all you have to do is write the literal dynamic data key in the box:

```
user.loggedIn
```

In the code, this outputs as:

```html
{#if user.loggedIn}
  <!-- logout link -->
{/if}
```

You don't have to do this: `{#if user.loggedIn == true}` because a boolean check is implied for boolean values.

Now, let's tackle the "is user **not** logged in" side of things.

Add another condition block (outside of the first one) and put another link inside of it. This will be for the "login" link (since the user is logged out if this condition is true).

Ask yourself the two questions again:

- **What data do I want to check?**: Once again, we want to check the [Dynamic Data Key](/dynamic-data/dynamic-data-keys), `user.loggedIn`.
- **Should I write the statement as positive or negative to show the element?**: In this case, we want to write it as a negative so that it resolves to true (and shows our element) if the user is not logged in.

How do we check if it's false? By putting a "!" in front of the key.

```
!user.loggedIn
```
That's it!

You've now created two very basic conditions for a very common scenario in web design!

And since conditions are blocks in the editor, you are free to drag whatever elements you want into either condition. It's very flexible. You don't need one condition per element â€“ a single condition can control an entire collection of elements.

## Non-Boolean Conditions

If you need to check a specific value, like the value of a custom field, then you will use comparison operators. Understanding the difference between loose and strict comparisons is crucial for writing reliable conditions.

### Loose vs Strict Comparisons

**Loose Comparisons (`==` and `!=`)**
- Compares values after attempting type conversion
- `"5" == 5` returns `true` (string "5" is converted to number 5)
- `true == 1` returns `true` (boolean true is converted to number 1)
- `false == 0` returns `true` (boolean false is converted to number 0)

**Use Loose Comparisons when:**
- You want flexible matching regardless of data type
- You expect the data might come in different formats

**Strict Comparisons (`===` and `!==`)**
- Compares both value AND type without conversion
- `"5" === 5` returns `false` (string vs number)
- `true === 1` returns `false` (boolean vs number)
- `false === 0` returns `false` (boolean vs number)

**Use Strict Comparisons when:**
- You need precise type and value matching
- Working with exact data validation
- You want to prevent unexpected type conversion bugs

### Practical Examples

For this example, let's say you're creating a star rating component. We'll keep it simple and say the rating can be whole numbers from 1 to 5.

In your component, create a prop called "rating." This is where we'll place the number and this is the prop we'll check the value of in the condition.

One way to do this would be to create five conditions that all check the rating value. If the rating equals 1, show one star. If the rating equals 2, show two stars.

**Using Loose Comparison (Flexible):**
```html
{#if props.rating == 1}
  <!-- Star 1 -->
{/if}
{#if props.rating == 2}
  <!-- Star 1 --> <!-- Star 2 -->
{/if}
{#if props.rating == 3}
  <!-- Star 1 --> <!-- Star 2 --> <!-- Star 3 -->
{/if}
```

This approach works whether `props.rating` is the number `2` or the string `"2"`.

**Using Strict Comparison (Precise):**
```html
{#if props.rating === 1}
  <!-- Star 1 -->
{/if}
{#if props.rating === 2}
  <!-- Star 1 --> <!-- Star 2 -->
{/if}
{#if props.rating === 3}
  <!-- Star 1 --> <!-- Star 2 --> <!-- Star 3 -->
{/if}
```

This approach only works if `props.rating` is exactly the number (not a string representation).

## Values vs Strings

Let's continue with the above example, but tackle it with a more efficient (requires fewer star elements) and flexible (since it supports decimal values) approach.

For this approach, we'll check the actual numerical value of the rating using mathematical operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`):

```html
{#if props.rating >= 1}
  <!-- Star -->
{/if}
{#if props.rating >= 2}
  <!-- Star -->
{/if}
{#if props.rating >= 3}
  <!-- Star -->
{/if}
{#if props.rating >= 4}
  <!-- Star -->
{/if}
{#if props.rating >= 5}
  <!-- Star -->
{/if}
```

There are two very important and distinct differences you need to understand:

1. We're checking a VALUE (math) instead of a STRING (text).
2. This is denoted by removing the quotations around the value.

Look closely:

`{#if props.rating === "2"}` says, "Show the element if the value of `props.rating` literally says "2".

But when you write `{#if props.rating >= 2}`, Etch can actually calculate the value and see if the condition is true, because it knows that 2 is equal to 2. And the condition that comes before it, `{#if props.rating >= 1}` will also be true because Etch knows that 2 is greater than 1.

You would never write `{#if props.rating >= "2"}` because "greater or equal" is irrelevant when examining a string of text. Again, putting the quotes around the number tell Etch that you want to examine "2" as a string, and not a numerical value.

That's a critical distinction that many beginners get wrong.

## Best Practices

1. **Use strict comparisons (`===`, `!==`) by default** to avoid unexpected behavior
2. **Use loose comparisons (`==`, `!=`) only when you specifically need type flexibility**
3. **Always use quotes around text values** and never around numbers or booleans
4. **Use mathematical operators (`>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`) for numerical ranges**

## Practice Makes Perfect

The first step to learning how to use conditions is to not be afraid of them.

Conditional logic is a critical piece of advanced web development and personalized web experiences. Once you've used them a few times, you'll quickly get comfortable. And once you get comfortable, things get really fun!
