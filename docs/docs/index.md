# Etch Documentation

:::warning
**Etch is Pre-Alpha.** We release weekly, typically on Thursdays, and each release is an in-progress release. Expect missing features, bugs, and limited functionality in certain areas. 

These docs are also a work in progress. Many docs are empty to establish proper hierarchy, organization, and internal linking for other doc articles. New docs arrive weekly.

With all that said, we encourage the full use of Etch on local environments and sandboxes and the use of Etch on small-scope and low-consequence production sites as long as you accept the risks that come from using bleeding-edge releases.

We are aiming to release v1 with backward compatibility protection in September 2025.

## What is Etch?

Etch is a WordPress plugin that provides a visual website builder with the following features:

- **Visual Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface for building pages
- **Content Manager**: A modern UI for managing content and content architecture
- **Auto Block Authoring**: Automatically authors your project to core Gutenberg blocks
- **Components**: Build reusable, customizable UI elements to speed up your workflow and maintain consistency across your site.
- **Loops**: Dynamically repeat content or components based on data, such as lists of posts, products, or custom fields.
- **Conditional Logic**: Show or hide elements, or change their behavior, based on dynamic conditions or user input.
- **JS & PHP Authoring**: Write and manage custom JavaScript and PHP directly within the builder for advanced functionality and integrations.
