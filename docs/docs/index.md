# Welcome to Etch

Etch is the first and only Unified Visual Development Environment for WordPress. It empowers users to build WordPress websites efficiently in a scalable, maintainable way with full code access. It's all the benefits of a traditional page builder with none of the downsides.

## What Makes Etch Different

Unlike traditional page builders that generate bloated code, block code access, and lock you into proprietary systems, Etch provides a transparent visual interface that directly manipulates real HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. You get the speed and convenience of visual development without sacrificing code quality, control, or web standards.

**Key Principles:**
- **Total Transparency** – Every element is accessible and editabl via GUI or code. No hidden wrappers or mysterious containers.
- **Auto Block Authoring** – Everything you build is authored to Gutenberg blocks instantly and automatically for data liberation and easy client editing.
- **Crystal Clean Output** – Professional-grade code that you'd be proud to write by hand.
- **Web Standards** – Work with Semantic HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript as they were designed to work.
- **Full Empowerment** – Complete control over your code without limitations.
- **Hyper-Efficiency** – Etch turns traditionally complex tasks like building loops, components, dynamic templates, conditional elements, and custom blocks into easy money.

## Who Etch Is For

Etch is built for freelancers, agencies, and developers who want to:
- Build WordPress sites faster without compromising code quality
- Maintain full control over their markup and styling
- Scale projects with reusable components and systematic workflows
- Deliver clean, maintainable code to clients with a simple client editing interface

**Etch also happens to be the best tool for beginners who are learning the craft of web development** because it respects web development fundamentals and best practices, doesn't box you into learning a proprietary system, and also happens to have the highest quality free education in the WordPress space along with a robust community of users willing to help you learn.
