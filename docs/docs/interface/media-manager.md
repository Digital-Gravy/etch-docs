# Media Manager

Etch will eventually have a fully-featured "Media Hub" that allows you to:

- Optimize image size and resolution
- Organize media with a tag-based system
- Bulk-manage media
- Regenerate thumbnails
- Manipulate image data like alt tags, titles, etc.
- Replace images
- And more...

For now, the Media Hub is just a function call to launch the WordPress Media Library inside of the Etch Interface. This empowers users to do basic media management without having to leave Etch, but this is certainly not our ultimate vision for media management.

This temporary workflow will remain in place while we focus on other mission-critical features and then we'll wrap back around to building Etch's native Media Hub.

Stay tuned!
