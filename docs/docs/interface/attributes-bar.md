# Attributes Bar

Etch's **Attributes Bar** is fastest and easiest way to add attributes to an element.

An attribute is a key-value pair added to an HTML element that controls its behavior, appearance, or provides additional information. Common attributes are things like: IDs, classes, ARIA labels, and data attributes.

Unlike traditional builders, Etch has a full attribute and selector system, not just a `class` system. Not only can you add any attributes to elements using the Attributes Bar, you can add selectors for them as well.

## Accessing the Attributes Bar

You can access the Attributes Bar by selecting any element and pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on Mac, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on Windows/Linux.

You can also click the "+" icon in the header of the HTML, CSS, or Style panels.

## Adding Attributes

The Attribute Bar accepts one or multiple attributes and selectors and you're free to mix and match attributes and selectors.

### Basic Selectors

The most common and basic example of adding a selector is adding a class or ID.

You add a class by writing the class name just like you'd write it in a CSS stylesheet. This will add the class to the `class` attribute on the element and create a selector for it that can be styled.

```css
.my-class
```

IDs work the same way:

```css
#my-id
```

You can add both at the same time:

```css
.my-class #my-id
```

### Random Selectors

If you need a one-off `class` or `ID`, Etch can auto-generate a unique one with `rand`.

```css
.rand
```

This works for both classes `.rand` and IDs `#rand`.

### Pseudo Classes

You can easily add pseudo classes and pseudo elements as selectors:

```css
.my-class:hover .my-class::before .my-class::after
```

In some cases it's very convenient to create selectors like this, but in other cases it may be better to use CSS Nesting on your parent selector to manage the styles for these things as nesting will result in consolidated CSS that can be managed in one place. Up to you!

### Other Attributes

If you want to add a `data` attribute, `aria-label`, etc. to an element:

```css
data-attribute="my-data" aria-label="This is accessible"
```

This will add the attributes to the HTML, but will not generate selectors. If you want to generate a selector for these items, put them in brackets (just like CSS):

```css
[data-attribute="my-data"]
```

### Complex and Compound Selectors

The Attribute Bar accepts complex and compound selectors, but these need to be put in braces:

```css
{.hero h1}
```

Any valid CSS selector, regardless of complexity, is supported.

## Styling Selectors

Styling in Etch is based on the [Selector Pill](selector-pills) that's currently selected. You can style them with the CSS editor the Styles panel. Your styles will always be bi-directionally synced, so there's no tradeoffs to either workflow. You can even mix and match how you approach styling.
