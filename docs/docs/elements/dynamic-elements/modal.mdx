# Modal

:::note
This page documents the recommended way to add a Modal by importing the prebuilt component with Copy/Paste JSON below.
:::

## Setup

- Add a container or a flex-div on your site if you don't already have one.
- You'll paste the Modal component into the container or flex-div in the next step.

## Importing the Component

Use the button below to copy the ready-to-use Modal component as JSON.
Then, in Etch, press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Windows) anywhere in the builder to insert the component.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  <CopyToClipboard label="Copy Modal Component" value={MODAL_JSON} />
</div>

### Steps
- Click "Copy Modal Component" above, then in Etch press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Mac) / <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (Windows) anywhere in the builder to insert the component
- Arrange the component inside your container or flex-div.
- Verify the component.

### Configuration
- CSS, JS, and props are bundled inside the component—no setup required. You can edit prop values to customize behavior.
- Styling: tweak CSS variables on `.etch-modal` (e.g., colors, icon sizes).
- Fill the props in the Elements Settings panel.


## Editing the Modal

Modal comes with 2 slots, if you open the modal and you don't see the slots, you will need to add them.

### Adding the slots ( if they are not already there )

Once you select the modal, on the bottom bar where are all the elements, you will see 2 slots icons on the left, click on them and you should see the slots appear on the modal.

Now your modal should contain 2 slots named `closebutton` and `dialogcontent`

### Adding content to the slots
- You can add content to the modal by adding content to the slots.

- `closebutton` slot is the button that will close the modal.
  - Set the prop `Use Close Button` to true so that the button will be rendered.
  - You **only need to add the content** for the button. The button itself **already exists**.
  - You can add text, icons, etc.
- `dialogcontent` slot is the content that will be displayed in the modal.
  - You can add any content to the slot.
  - You can add text, images, create cards, use divs, the slot is a normal div container.

:::tip
You can edit the content while the modal is open by adding a trigger to the modal.
:::

### Adding a trigger to the modal

Lets select the modal component and see the Elements Settings panel.

On that Panel there will be a prop called `triggerSelector`, type there a .class or an #id from the element that you want to trigger the modal from.
