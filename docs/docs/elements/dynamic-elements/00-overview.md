# Dynamic Elements

Conventional page builders often refer to things like sliders, modals, accordions, etc. as components. This is a technically incorrect and problematic naming decision. In Etch, we call these elements, "Dynamic Elements." This differentiates them from simple elements like headings, paragraphs, and links without confusing them with [component-based functionality](../../components/intro-components).
