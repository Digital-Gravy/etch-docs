# Anchor (Link)

The Anchor element (commonly but incorrectly referred to as a "Link" element) produces a `<a href="#">Hyperlink</a>`. 

## Mandatory attributes

`href=""` is the mandatory attribute for anchors, which is why it's added automatically. This is the destination of the link. You can edit the value for this attribute via the HTML editor, the attributes panel, or the Attribute bar.

## Open in New Tab

If you want your anchor to open in a new tab, you can add `target="_blank"` via the Attributes bar or the HTML editor.

## Buttons vs Links

It's important to remember that anchors are navigational elements. If you're navigating the user to another part of the page, or to a new page entirely, then an anchor is appropriate.

Anchors can look like buttons visually, but this is done via CSS, not by changing the actual HTML tag to `<button>`.

If you are triggering an on-page event, like firing a modal or advancing slides in a carousel, then an anchor is _inappropriate_. On-page events should be triggered with a `<button>` element.

Anchors can be transformed into buttons by changing the HTML tag, but you should remove any anchor-based attributes when you do this.

Buttons can also be added by adding a Text, Div, or Flex Div element and changing the tag to `<button>`. Doing this will save you the step of having to remove the link attributes.

We did not include a literal Button element in Etch for two big reasons:

1. Buttons are used far less frequently than anchors.
2. The word "button" creates tremendous confusion between visual and semantic use.

It's better to provide an **Anchor** element knowing that users who understand the semantic distinction between buttons and anchors can easily make a button themselves out of any of the existing elements or simply by writing it in the HTML in the few scenarios where a button is required.
