# Heading

The Heading element in Etch adds an `<h2>` heading by default since `H2` is the most used heading level on most pages. You can change this to any other heading level by editing the tag.

Remember, it's bad practice to change the tag just for the sole purpose of changing the font-size or visual styling of the heading. Make sure you set the tag based on proper semantics and then control styling requirements with CSS.
