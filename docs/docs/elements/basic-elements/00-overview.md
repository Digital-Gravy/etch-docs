# Basic Elements

Basic elements are the fundamental building blocks of web pages in Etch. These are simple, static elements like headings, paragraphs, containers, and links that form the foundation of your page structure. Unlike [Dynamic Elements](../dynamic-elements/overview) which provide interactive functionality, basic elements focus on content structure and presentation.
