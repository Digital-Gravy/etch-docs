# Div

A div is the basic building block of everything in web design. It's essentially a blank box that contains and groups other elements.

In Etch, the Div element has no default styling. It's exactly what you'd expect: `<div></div>`.

:::note
Since a `<div>` is `display: block;` by default in web design, you can't use flex alignments or gaps unless you manually set the `display` to `flex`. If you want to avoid having to make this change manually, you can use the [Flex Div](flex-div) element instead.
