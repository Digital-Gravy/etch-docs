# Loop

The Loop element in Etch is a ghost element that provides a containing context for loop functionality and gives you access to loop controls. It does not actually output anything in the DOM/canvas itself. 

For more details on how to use loops, see the [Basic Loops](../../../loops/basic-loops) guide.
