# Text

The Text element in Etch is a basic paragraph `<p>` element by default, though it can be morphed into any other kind of text element. For example, it can become a `span`, `li`, or any other valid element.

:::warning
A single text element should not be used for rich text (multiple paragraphs inside a single text element) or as the wrapping element for rich dynamic data.
