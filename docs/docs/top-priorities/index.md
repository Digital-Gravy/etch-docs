# Current Priorities

This page outlines the key areas we're focusing on most actively, but it's important to understand that priorities can change quickly based on various factors:

1. **Our vision** - What we think needs to happen next.
2. **Real-world use cases** - Where people are getting stuck.
3. **User feedback** - What people are saying about their experience.

**This page should not be treated as a fixed roadmap.** It's a fluid and flexible attempt to communicate what's currently important. It's also limited to the top 5 large-scale items across two different categories because prioritization beyond that is too fluid to worry about.

:::note
Bux fixes, general improvements, and minor features are not listed here. The purpose of this page is for communicating larger-scale priorities. It goes without saying that bug fixes and general improvements are always a top priority.
