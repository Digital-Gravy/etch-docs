# Image Prop

The Image Prop allows you to reference an image file from the media library or any image URL.

:::note
The image prop does not automatically pull any `alt` value from the media library. For full image support, it's best to create an image prop and then a text prop for the image's `alt` tag.
:::

:::warning
The image prop does not currently support `srcset`, but will in the future.
